# Countries and languages App (React with TypeScript)

Welcome to the **Countries and Languages App**! This project is a single-page application developed using React with TypeScript. It leverages Apollo Client and GraphQL to fetch and manage data dynamically and uses styled-components for component-level styling. The application was built as part of a learning journey to deepen knowledge of modern web development technologies like React, JavaScript, and GraphQL.

## Features
**React with TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and scalability for the project.
**Apollo Client and GraphQL**: Simplifies data fetching and state management with a GraphQL backend.
**Styled-components**: Enables writing modular, maintainable styles directly within the components.
**Ramda.js**: Provides functional utilities for clean and concise code.
**Webpack and Babel**: Used to bundle and transpile the application for modern browser support.

This project is a practical exploration of integrating multiple technologies and tools to create a performant, well-structured, and visually appealing application.
